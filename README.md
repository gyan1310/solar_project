important concept 
Azimuth Angle is primarily responsible for horizontal movement or rotation of solar panels to track the sun's position along the horizon (east-west).
Zenith Angle is primarily responsible for vertical adjustment or tilting of solar panels to track the sun's elevation in the sky (up-down).
Together, the Azimuth and Zenith angles allow solar tracking systems to continuously adjust the orientation of panels so that they face the sun throughout the day, maximizing energy production.

data.csv is the file which cantains the solar data for the year 2022
data_cleaning() this is the function where we take the data.csv as an input file and seperate the date col and rename the col of the A and E as Elevation_08:00:00  Azimuth_08:00:00
